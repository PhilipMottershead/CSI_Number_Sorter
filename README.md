# CSI_Number_Sorter

## Task

This application must perform the following tasks and built to best practices:
1. Allow the user to enter a variable amount of numbers, of any integer value and in random
order.
2. Sort these numbers in either ascending or descending order â€“ the user should choose the
order.
3. The ordered sequence should be inserted into the database along with the direction that the
sequence was sorted in and the time taken to perform the sort.
4. Feedback to the user the result of the operation (i.e. whether the operation was successful,
any validation issues with the submission or any errors that occurred).
5. Display the results of all sorts including the sort direction and time taken.
6. Allow the user to export all of the sorts as JSON.
7. Please document all assumptions and decisions taken separately and submit with final code
base.
